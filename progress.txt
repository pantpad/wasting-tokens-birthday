## 2026-01-08 20:01 UTC - Feature: Project Setup with React, Vite, and Howler.js

### Implemented
- Created Vite + React + TypeScript project structure
- Installed dependencies: howler.js ^2.2.4, react ^18.3.1, react-dom ^18.3.1
- Configured Vite for static asset handling (videos, audios, images)
- Set up mobile viewport meta tag with no pinch zoom
- Configured ESLint and Vitest for testing
- Created symlinks in public/ to existing audios/ and videos/ folders
- Created public/images/ directory for BMW assets

### Files Created
- package.json - Project dependencies and scripts
- tsconfig.json - TypeScript configuration
- vite.config.ts - Vite configuration with asset handling
- vitest.config.ts - Test configuration
- eslint.config.js - ESLint configuration
- index.html - Entry HTML with mobile viewport meta
- src/main.tsx - React entry point
- src/App.tsx - Main application component
- src/App.css - Application styles
- src/index.css - Global styles
- src/vite-env.d.ts - Vite type definitions
- src/test/setup.ts - Test setup
- src/App.test.tsx - Basic test
- public/vite.svg - Favicon
- public/audios -> symlink to ../audios
- public/videos -> symlink to ../videos
- public/images/ - Directory for BMW images

### Verified
- pnpm typecheck passes
- pnpm test passes (1 test)
- pnpm build produces dist/ output

### Notes for Next Agent
- The project is now set up and ready for UI development
- Next priority should be either "File structure matches spec.md layout" or "Black Void Entry screen"
- Audio and video files are accessible via public/ symlinks
- BMW images (bmw-white.png, bmw-logo.png) still need to be added to public/images/

## 2026-01-08 20:04 UTC - Feature: Black Void Entry Screen

### Implemented
- Created the Black Void Entry screen as the initial user-facing view
- Pure black (#000000) background fills entire viewport
- White "TAP HERE" text centered on screen
- Subtle pulsing animation on text to draw attention (opacity + scale)
- Uses 100dvh for proper mobile address bar handling
- No loading indicators or other UI elements (minimal "broken" feel)
- Touch-friendly with proper cursor and user-select settings

### Files Changed
- src/App.tsx - Replaced placeholder content with entry screen component
- src/App.css - Complete rewrite with entry-screen styles and pulse animation
- src/App.test.tsx - Updated tests to verify entry screen elements

### Verified
- pnpm typecheck passes
- pnpm test passes (3 tests)

### Notes for Next Agent
- The entry screen is now complete and ready for interaction handling
- Next priority should be "First tap unlocks audio context and triggers chaos"
- The screen waits for user tap but doesn't handle it yet - that's the next feature
- Consider also the "File structure matches spec.md layout" task for BMW images

## 2026-01-08 20:07 UTC - Feature: First Tap Unlocks Audio Context and Triggers Chaos

### Implemented
- Added state management (chaosStarted) to track entry/chaos mode transition
- Implemented tap/click handler on entry screen that:
  - Resumes AudioContext if suspended (iOS requirement)
  - Initializes Howler.js for audio playback
  - Transitions UI from black void entry to chaos container
- Added keyboard accessibility (Enter/Space to start)
- Made entire entry screen tappable (not just the text)
- Created chaos-container and chaos-active CSS classes for the chaos mode UI
- No audio plays before first interaction (per spec requirement)

### Files Changed
- src/App.tsx - Added chaosStarted state, unlockAudio function, handleEntryTap handler, and chaos mode JSX
- src/App.css - Updated entry-screen styles, added chaos-container and chaos-active styles
- src/App.test.tsx - Added comprehensive tests for tap-to-start functionality (9 total tests)
- plans/prd.json - Marked feature as passes: true

### Verified
- pnpm typecheck passes
- pnpm test passes (9 tests)

### Notes for Next Agent
- The tap-to-start functionality is now complete
- Chaos container is a placeholder - next features should add actual content (videos, effects)
- Good next priorities: "TikTok-style vertical video feed" or "Audio chaos system triggers sounds"
- The Howler.js mock is set up in tests, ready for audio testing

## 2026-01-08 20:09 UTC - Feature: TikTok-style Vertical Video Feed

### Implemented
- Full-screen vertical video container using object-fit: cover
- Video element with autoplay, loop, muted, and playsInline attributes
- Random starting video selection from the video pool
- VIDEO_POOL constant with all 4 available videos
- CSS styles for video feed with GPU-accelerated transforms
- Video fills viewport properly on mobile (9:16 aspect ratio content)
- handleVideoCanPlay callback to ensure autoplay starts

### Files Changed
- src/App.tsx - Added VIDEO_POOL, currentVideoIndex state, videoRef, video element with proper attributes
- src/App.css - Added .video-feed and .video-player styles for full-screen vertical display
- src/App.test.tsx - Added 5 new tests for video feed functionality (14 total tests)
- plans/prd.json - Marked feature as passes: true

### Verified
- pnpm typecheck passes
- pnpm test passes (14 tests)

### Notes for Next Agent
- Video feed is now functional with full-screen display
- Videos are muted to allow autoplay (browser requirement)
- Good next priorities: "Swipe navigation changes video content" or "Audio chaos system triggers sounds"
- The currentVideoIndex state is ready for swipe navigation to modify
- Consider adding unmute functionality once user starts interacting

## 2026-01-08 20:12 UTC - Feature: Swipe Navigation Changes Video Content

### Implemented
- Touch event handling for swipe detection (touchstart, touchmove, touchend)
- SWIPE_THRESHOLD constant (50px) for minimum swipe distance
- goToNextVideo() and goToPreviousVideo() navigation functions
- Swipe up navigates to next video in pool
- Swipe down navigates to previous video in pool
- Video wraps around at pool boundaries (circular navigation)
- Horizontal swipes are ignored (only vertical swipes trigger navigation)
- Default scroll behavior prevented via touchmove handler
- Touch tracking refs for accurate swipe detection

### Files Changed
- src/App.tsx - Added touch refs, SWIPE_THRESHOLD, touch handlers, navigation functions
- src/App.test.tsx - Added 7 new tests for swipe navigation (21 total tests)
- plans/prd.json - Marked feature as passes: true

### Verified
- pnpm typecheck passes
- pnpm test passes (21 tests)

### Notes for Next Agent
- Swipe navigation is fully functional with TikTok-style vertical swiping
- Videos loop through the pool in both directions
- Good next priorities: "Audio chaos system triggers sounds" for core chaos functionality
- The chaos container now has touch event handlers attached
- Consider mouse wheel support for desktop users in the future
