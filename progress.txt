### Notes for Next Agent
- The project is now set up and ready for UI development
- Next priority should be either "File structure matches spec.md layout" or "Black Void Entry screen"
- Audio and video files are accessible via public/ symlinks
- BMW images (bmw-white.png, bmw-logo.png) still need to be added to public/images/

## 2026-01-08 20:04 UTC - Feature: Black Void Entry Screen

### Implemented
- Created the Black Void Entry screen as the initial user-facing view
- Pure black (#000000) background fills entire viewport
- White "TAP HERE" text centered on screen
- Subtle pulsing animation on text to draw attention (opacity + scale)
- Uses 100dvh for proper mobile address bar handling
- No loading indicators or other UI elements (minimal "broken" feel)
- Touch-friendly with proper cursor and user-select settings

### Files Changed
- src/App.tsx - Replaced placeholder content with entry screen component
- src/App.css - Complete rewrite with entry-screen styles and pulse animation
- src/App.test.tsx - Updated tests to verify entry screen elements

### Verified
- pnpm typecheck passes
- pnpm test passes (3 tests)

### Notes for Next Agent
- The entry screen is now complete and ready for interaction handling
- Next priority should be "First tap unlocks audio context and triggers chaos"
- The screen waits for user tap but doesn't handle it yet - that's the next feature
- Consider also the "File structure matches spec.md layout" task for BMW images

## 2026-01-08 20:07 UTC - Feature: First Tap Unlocks Audio Context and Triggers Chaos

### Implemented
- Added state management (chaosStarted) to track entry/chaos mode transition
- Implemented tap/click handler on entry screen that:
  - Resumes AudioContext if suspended (iOS requirement)
  - Initializes Howler.js for audio playback
  - Transitions UI from black void entry to chaos container
- Added keyboard accessibility (Enter/Space to start)
- Made entire entry screen tappable (not just the text)
- Created chaos-container and chaos-active CSS classes for the chaos mode UI
- No audio plays before first interaction (per spec requirement)

### Files Changed

- pnpm test passes (9 tests)

### Notes for Next Agent
- The tap-to-start functionality is now complete
- Chaos container is a placeholder - next features should add actual content (videos, effects)
- Good next priorities: "TikTok-style vertical video feed" or "Audio chaos system triggers sounds"
- The Howler.js mock is set up in tests, ready for audio testing

## 2026-01-08 20:09 UTC - Feature: TikTok-style Vertical Video Feed

### Implemented
- Full-screen vertical video container using object-fit: cover
- Video element with autoplay, loop, muted, and playsInline attributes
- Random starting video selection from the video pool
- VIDEO_POOL constant with all 4 available videos
- CSS styles for video feed with GPU-accelerated transforms
- Video fills viewport properly on mobile (9:16 aspect ratio content)
- handleVideoCanPlay callback to ensure autoplay starts

### Files Changed

### Verified
- pnpm typecheck passes
- pnpm test passes (14 tests)

### Notes for Next Agent
- Video feed is now functional with full-screen display
- Videos are muted to allow autoplay (browser requirement)
- Good next priorities: "Swipe navigation changes video content" or "Audio chaos system triggers sounds"
- The currentVideoIndex state is ready for swipe navigation to modify
- Consider adding unmute functionality once user starts interacting

## 2026-01-08 20:12 UTC - Feature: Swipe Navigation Changes Video Content

### Implemented
- Touch event handling for swipe detection (touchstart, touchmove, touchend)
- SWIPE_THRESHOLD constant (50px) for minimum swipe distance
- goToNextVideo() and goToPreviousVideo() navigation functions
- Swipe up navigates to next video in pool
- Swipe down navigates to previous video in pool
- Video wraps around at pool boundaries (circular navigation)
- Horizontal swipes are ignored (only vertical swipes trigger navigation)
- Default scroll behavior prevented via touchmove handler
- Touch tracking refs for accurate swipe detection

### Files Changed
- src/App.tsx - Added touch refs, SWIPE_THRESHOLD, touch handlers, navigation functions
- src/App.test.tsx - Added 7 new tests for swipe navigation (21 total tests)
- plans/prd.json - Marked feature as passes: true

### Verified
- pnpm typecheck passes
- pnpm test passes (21 tests)

### Notes for Next Agent
- Swipe navigation is fully functional with TikTok-style vertical swiping
- Videos loop through the pool in both directions
- Good next priorities: "Audio chaos system triggers sounds" for core chaos functionality
- The chaos container now has touch event handlers attached
- Consider mouse wheel support for desktop users in the future

## 2026-01-08 20:16 UTC - Feature: Audio Chaos System Triggers Sounds on Every Interaction

### Implemented
- Created AUDIO_POOL constant with all 9 audio files from /audios folder
- Added playRandomSound() function that creates Howl instances and plays random sounds
- Audio plays on click/tap in chaos container
- Audio plays on touch move events
- Audio plays on successful swipe navigation
- Audio plays on pointer move (desktop mouse interactions)
- Sound instances auto-cleanup after playback ends via 'end' event handler
- Sounds only play after chaos mode has started (not on entry screen)

### Files Changed
- src/App.tsx - Added AUDIO_POOL, playRandomSound function, event handlers for click/pointerMove
- src/App.test.tsx - Added 7 new tests for audio chaos system (28 total tests), updated Howl mock

### Verified
- pnpm typecheck passes
- pnpm test passes (28 tests)

### Notes for Next Agent
- Audio chaos system is now functional and plays random sounds on every interaction
- Volume is set to 0.5 to prevent immediate audio overload
- Next high-priority feature should be "Audio system enforces maximum simultaneous sounds" (max 8 sounds)
- The escalation system would also benefit from audio integration
- Consider adding throttling to prevent too many sounds on rapid interactions

## 2026-01-08 20:19 UTC - Feature: Audio System Enforces Maximum Simultaneous Sounds

### Implemented
- Added MAX_SIMULTANEOUS_SOUNDS constant (8) to limit concurrent audio playback
- Created ActiveSound interface to track Howl instances with start timestamps
- Implemented activeSoundsRef to track all currently playing sounds
- Added removeFromActiveSounds() function to clean up finished sounds
- Implemented applyVolumeDucking() that reduces volume when 5+ sounds are playing
  - DUCKING_THRESHOLD = 5 sounds
  - BASE_VOLUME = 0.5, DUCKED_VOLUME = 0.3
- Implemented fadeOutOldestSound() that fades and removes oldest sound when at capacity
  - FADEOUT_DURATION = 200ms for smooth fadeout
  - Sorts by startTime to find oldest sound
- Updated playRandomSound() to:
  - Check if at max limit and fade out oldest if needed
  - Apply appropriate initial volume based on ducking state
  - Track new sounds in activeSoundsRef
  - Apply ducking after adding new sounds
  - Clean up tracking on sound end

### Files Changed
- src/App.tsx - Added constants, ActiveSound interface, tracking refs, and limiting functions
- src/App.test.tsx - Updated mock to support volume() and fade() methods, added 6 new tests

### Verified
- pnpm typecheck passes
- pnpm test passes (34 tests, including 6 new audio limiting tests)

### Notes for Next Agent
- Audio system now properly limits to 8 simultaneous sounds
- Volume ducking provides compression rather than clipping
- Good next priorities: "Time-based escalation system" or "File structure matches spec.md layout"
- The escalation system is a major feature that gates many visual effects

## 2026-01-08 20:22 UTC - Feature: Time-based Escalation System

### Implemented
- Added chaosLevel state that starts at 1 and increments to 10 over 10 seconds
- Created escalation timer using setInterval with 1000ms interval
- Timer automatically clears when chaos level reaches maximum (10)
- Added MAX_CHAOS_LEVEL (10) and ESCALATION_INTERVAL (1000ms) constants
- Exposed chaos level via data-chaos-level attribute on chaos container
- Timer properly cleans up on component unmount
- useEffect manages the timer lifecycle based on chaosStarted state

### Files Changed
- src/App.tsx - Added chaosLevel state, escalationTimerRef, useEffect for timer, data-chaos-level attribute
- src/App.test.tsx - Added 6 new tests for escalation system (40 total tests), imported act from @testing-library/react
- plans/prd.json - Marked feature as passes: true

### Verified
- pnpm typecheck passes
- pnpm test passes (40 tests)

### Notes for Next Agent
- The time-based escalation system is now functional
- Chaos level is exposed via data-chaos-level attribute for CSS targeting and testing
- Many visual effects in the PRD depend on this chaos level (rotation at 4+, hue at 5+, glitch at 7+, etc.)
- Good next priorities: "Chaos level persists after reaching maximum" or visual effects that use chaos level
- The chaosLevel variable is available in the component for conditional rendering based on level

## 2026-01-08 20:26 UTC - Feature: Chaos Level Persists After Reaching Maximum

### Implemented
- Chaos level stays at 10 permanently after reaching maximum (timer stops)
- Swiping changes video but does NOT reset chaos level
- No mechanism to decrease chaos level exists in the implementation
- Added "Happy Birthday Michael" text overlay that appears at max chaos level (10)
- Bold white Impact font with text-shadow for visibility over video
- Pulsing animation on the birthday text for emphasis
- Session maintains chaos state throughout

### Files Changed
- src/App.tsx - Added isMaxChaos check and Happy Birthday overlay component
- src/App.css - Added .happy-birthday-overlay and .happy-birthday-text styles with birthday-pulse animation
- src/App.test.tsx - Added 7 new tests for chaos persistence and Happy Birthday text (47 total tests)
- plans/prd.json - Marked feature as passes: true

### Verified
- pnpm typecheck passes
- pnpm test passes (47 tests)

### Notes for Next Agent
- Chaos level persistence is now complete with Happy Birthday text at max chaos
- The Happy Birthday text appears as a centered overlay - full floating animation will be in separate feature
- Good next priorities: "Video clones duplicate and multiply on screen" or UI effects like "Screen shake"
- Many visual effects now have the chaos level system to build upon

## 2026-01-08 20:29 UTC - Feature: Screen Shake Effect Intensifies with Chaos Level

### Implemented
- Added screen shake effect that activates at chaos level 3 and intensifies up to level 10
- Created constants for shake configuration:
  - SHAKE_START_LEVEL = 3 (chaos level when shake begins)
  - SHAKE_MIN_INTERVAL = 50ms (interval at max chaos - violent shaking)
  - SHAKE_MAX_INTERVAL = 200ms (interval at start - subtle shaking)
  - SHAKE_MIN_INTENSITY = 2px (subtle shake at level 3)
  - SHAKE_MAX_INTENSITY = 15px (violent shake at max chaos)
- Added shakeOffset state and shakeTimerRef for tracking shake animation
- Implemented useEffect that manages shake animation:
  - Calculates intensity based on chaos level (3-10 maps to min-max)
  - Calculates interval (slower at level 3, faster at level 10)
  - Uses setInterval for continuous random position updates
  - Cleans up on unmount or when chaos level changes below threshold
- Applied shake transform to chaos-active container via inline style
- Added data-testid="chaos-content" for testing the shake element
- Updated CSS with GPU acceleration (will-change, backface-visibility)

### Files Changed
- src/App.tsx - Added shake constants, state, useEffect, and transform style
- src/App.css - Added GPU acceleration styles to .chaos-active
- src/App.test.tsx - Added 6 new tests for screen shake (53 total tests)
- plans/prd.json - Marked feature as passes: true

### Verified
- pnpm typecheck passes
- pnpm test passes (53 tests)

### Notes for Next Agent
- Screen shake is now fully functional with intensity scaling from chaos level 3-10
- Shake uses CSS transforms for GPU-accelerated animation
- The shake effect uses random offsets within the intensity range
- Good next priorities: "Color manipulation effects" (CSS filters) or "Video clones duplicate"
- The chaosLevel variable is available for other effects to use the same escalation pattern

## 2026-01-08 20:39 UTC - Feature: File Structure Matches spec.md Layout

### Implemented
- Verified all required directories exist: /audios (9 files), /videos (4 files), /public/images
- Confirmed symlinks in public/ directory for audios and videos are working correctly
- Added IMAGE_POOL constant with BMW asset paths (bmw-white.png, bmw-logo.png) for future BMW integration feature
- Exported IMAGE_POOL so it's available for use by other features
- Verified all media files are accessible via Vite static serving through public/ symlinks
- File structure now matches spec.md layout requirements

### Files Changed
- src/App.tsx - Added IMAGE_POOL constant with BMW image paths, exported for future use

### Verified
- pnpm typecheck passes
- pnpm test passes (53 tests)
- All required directories exist and are properly structured
- Symlinks verified and working

### Notes for Next Agent
- File structure is now complete and matches the spec.md layout
- Audio and video files are accessible via public/ symlinks (9 audio files, 4 video files)
- Image directory exists at public/images/ but BMW image files (bmw-white.png, bmw-logo.png) still need to be added by user
- IMAGE_POOL constant is ready for use when BMW integration feature is implemented
- Good next priorities: Visual effects like "Video clones duplicate", "Color manipulation effects", or "BMW integration" (once images are added)
