- Good next priorities: "Chaos level persists after reaching maximum" or visual effects that use chaos level
- The chaosLevel variable is available in the component for conditional rendering based on level

## 2026-01-08 20:26 UTC - Feature: Chaos Level Persists After Reaching Maximum

- Created constants for shake configuration:
  - SHAKE_START_LEVEL = 3 (chaos level when shake begins)
  - SHAKE_MIN_INTERVAL = 50ms (interval at max chaos - violent shaking)
  - SHAKE_MAX_INTERVAL = 200ms (interval at start - subtle shaking)
  - SHAKE_MIN_INTENSITY = 2px (subtle shake at level 3)
  - SHAKE_MAX_INTENSITY = 15px (violent shake at max chaos)
- Added shakeOffset state and shakeTimerRef for tracking shake animation
- Implemented useEffect that manages shake animation:
  - Calculates intensity based on chaos level (3-10 maps to min-max)
  - Calculates interval (slower at level 3, faster at level 10)
  - Uses setInterval for continuous random position updates
  - Cleans up on unmount or when chaos level changes below threshold

  - Level 3-10: Increasing clones from ~4 to MAX_VIDEO_CLONES (15) total
- Each clone has random properties:
  - Position: Random X/Y (10-90% of screen)
